# SpikGC

Discovering Granger causality from time series data is crucial for understanding dynamic systems. Traditional models struggle with nonlinear dependencies, limiting both accuracy and scalability. We introduce SpikGC, a novel spiking neural network-based approach that efficiently combines causal discovery with self-attention mechanisms. SpikGC leverages the event-driven dynamics of SNNs to enhance computational efficiency while effectively capturing complex nonlinear temporal dependencies. The model integrates causality-aware spiking attention layers, enabling dynamic causal inference with minimal power consumption. SpikGC outperforms existing neural Granger causality methods in both accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world time series analysis. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in high-performance causal discovery across complex systems.
